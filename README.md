## Project structure

When working in a large team with many developers that are responsible for the same codebase, having a common understanding of how the application should be structured is vital.
Based on best practices from the community, Nest and [Angular coding style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide), other github projects and developer experience, your project should look like this:

```html
â”œâ”€â”€ cicd
â”œâ”€â”€ db

```

All of the app's code goes in a folder named `src`. The end-to-end tests are in the `e2e` folder.
In Nest, everything is organized in modules, and every application have at least one of them, the `app` root module.
The `app` module is the entry point of the application and is the module that Nest uses to bootstrap the application.

The `auth` module contains the code responsible for authentication and authorization in the application.
The `core` module takes on the role of the `app` root module.
The `feature-*` folders contains all different feature modules. These modules are independent of each other.
Do declare filters, pipes, decorators, etc. in the `shared` module when those items will be re-used in other feature modules.
The `shared` module shouldn't have any dependency to the rest of the application.

Static files are placed in `assets` folder.

## Available npm scripts

The scripts in [package.json](package.json) file were built with simplicity in mind to automate as much repetitive tasks as possible and help developers focus on what really matters.
There are commands to start the application, code linting and formatting, code analysis via [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), to run unit tests, e2e and smoke tests, to generate project documentation via [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) and project changelog, npm audit, to build, release and deploy the application to [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), and others.
All the commands should be executed in a console inside the root directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nest generate controller controller-name` to generate a new controller.
You can also use `nest generate filter|pipe|service|class|guard|middleware|gateway|module|decorator|interceptor`.

## Development mode

Use `npm run start` to run the app in the development mode.
This app includes [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). It is available at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).
The [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) is exportable by running `npm run swagger` script.

## REST interface

REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
The common resource methods are GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.
This project follows [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification for building APIs in JSON.
To get a visual representation of the interface and send requests for testing purposes go to `http://localhost:3000/api`.
Alternatively, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is currently one of the most popular tools used.

## Data persistence

This project uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
In local development, you need to provide a connection to a PostgreSQL instance. You can use the next example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret postgres
```

The project supports database migrations. Use `npm run db:create` to create the project database and `npm run migrate` to up all migrations.
Use `npm run db:models` to generate or update the table models in the `db/models` folder.
The project uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) written in a vanilla JavaScript.

## Authentication and authorization

Authentication is an essential part of most applications. There are many different approaches and strategies to handle authentication.

[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) is an authentication standard that works by generating and signing tokens, passing them around between the client-side and server-side applications, passed around via query strings, authorization headers, or other mediums. Having such a valid and non-expired token, extracted from an HTTP Request, signals the fact that the user is authenticated and is allowed to access protected resources.

Authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is able to do.
For example, an administrative user is allowed to create, edit, and delete posts.
A non-administrative user is only authorized to read the posts.

You can extract user data from the session. User data is present in each request, as you can see in the next code snippet.

```typescript
refresh(@Request() { user }: { user: UserSession }): Promise<string>
```

## Linting and formatting code

Use `npm run lint` to analyze your code. It includes, `ESLint` and `Prettier`.
Many problems can be automatically fixed with `npm run lint:fix`.
These checks are supplemented with `SonarQube`.

Depending on your editor, you may want to add an editor extension to lint and format your code while we type or on-save.
To ensure all files committed to git don't have any TypeScript, linting, or formatting errors, there is a tool called [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) that can be used.
When lint-staged is used in combination with [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky), the linting commands specified with lint-staged can be executed to staged files on pre-commit.

## Running unit tests

Use `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
Use `npm run test:watch` to keep executing unit tests in real time while watching for file changes in the background.
You can see the HTML coverage report opening the [index.html](reports/coverage/lcov-report/index.html) file in your web browser.

If you want to exclude a specific test, simply use `xit()` or `xdescribe()`.
If you want to run a specific test, use `fit()` or `fdescribe()`.
The `x` means exclude and the `f` stands for focused.

## Running end-to-end tests

E2E Testing involves testing an application's workflow from beginning to end.
Use `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
Use `npm run e2e:watch` to keep executing your tests while watching for file changes in the background.
You can see the HTML report opening the [index.html](reports/e2e/index.html) file in your web browser.

## Running smoke tests

Smoke Testing is a technique to verify the critical functionalities of a software.
Use `npm run smoke` to execute the smoke tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) and [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/).
Use `npm run smoke:watch` to keep executing your tests while watching for file changes in the background.
You can see the HTML report opening the [index.html](reports/smoke/index.html) file in your web browser.

## Debugging

You can debug the code, add breakpoints, inspect variables and view the application's call stack.
Also, you can use the IDE for debugging unit, end-to-end and smoke tests.
These functionalities are provided natively or based on plugins.
You can debug tests in chrome inspector with `debugger` keyword if you run `npm run test:debug`, `npm run e2e:debug` or `npm run smoke:debug`.
When you are using the debug scripts, you need to open the `chrome://inspect` page.

## Profiling

Node.js is similar to many other coding languages in the sense that it needs to be used in conjunction with profilers and other tools to debug your program, overcome any bottlenecks, and optimize its functionality.
To ensure a blazing fast web server, you must first measure its performance so you can optimise it to its fullest potential.
[AutoCannon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autocannon) is one of many tools available for this purpose.
Use `npm run profile` to run the sample load test against the `health` endpoint.
Use `npm run profile:summarize` to summarize the metrics provided by Node.js built-in profiler.
In addition, [Clinic.js](https://clinicjs.org/) is a suite of tools to help diagnose and pinpoint your Node.js performance issues.

## Healthchecks and logging

The Nest Terminus integration supports you with readiness/liveness health checks.
Healthchecks are very important when it comes to complex backend setups.
It is available at [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health).
A service, or a component of your infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes) checks this address continuously.
Depending on the HTTP status code returned from a GET request to this address the service will take action when it receives an "unhealthy" response.

Nest comes with a built-in text-based logger which is used during application bootstrapping and several other circumstances such as displaying caught exceptions (i.e., system logging).
However, to improve these messages, it was override by [Pino](https://getpino.io/).
You can see Pino's configuration by opening the [app.logger.ts](src/app/app.logger.ts) file.

## Error handling

The REST API of the User Preferences signals all error conditions by an HTTP response status of either `4xx` or `5xx`.

Errors that were caused by invalid client requests are mapped to a response status of `4xx`:

- Request objects that violate a constraint given in the API description will result in a `400 Bad Request`,
- Request that does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource will result in a `401 Unauthorized`,
- Requests that refer to a non-existing object will result in a `404 Resource Not Found`.

On the other hand, technical errors that were caused inside the app will result in a `500 Internal Server Error`

## Security, performance and best practices

This project has [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) to protect the app from some known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately.
It has CORS enabled by default. You can see these configurations by opening the [main.ts](src/main.ts) file.
The `npm audit` command submits a description of the dependencies configured in your package to your default registry and asks for a report of known vulnerabilities
You can also have npm automatically fix the vulnerabilities by running `npm audit fix`.

By default, Nest makes use of the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) provides a good alternative framework for Nest because it solves design issues in a similar manner to Express.
However, Fastify is much faster than Express, achieving almost two times better benchmarks results.

Code conventions are base rules that allow the creation of a uniform code base across an organization.
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is very popular and recommended.
You can complete them with rules just for TypeScript.

## Commit messages convention

In order to have a consistent git history every commit must follow a specific template. Here's the template:

```bash
<type>(<ITEM ID>?): <subject>
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, Jenkins, SauceLabs)
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: A commit that reverts a previous one
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### ITEM ID

The related **issue** or **user story** or even **defect**.

- For **user stories**, you shoud use `US-` as prefix. Example: `feat(US-4321): ...`
- For **no related issues** or **defects** you should leave it blank. Example: `feat: ...`

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change.

## Build and deployment

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.
In `cicd` folder you can find scripts for your [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) CI pipeline, a Dockerfile and an example for deploying your application with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).
